This is my mouse which I like

These are the monitors I have - I think you can do better especially if you want to use a monitor stand. These do not have the connectors to yout have to get adaptors.

To connect multiple monitors and other devices to your mac you need a Thunderbolt 3 dock. This is the one I got. I would shop around for a different one if I were to rebuy. This cuts out periodically, the monitors just go blank!
